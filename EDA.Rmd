# importing all the necessary libraries
library(tsibble)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
```

## Import dataset

```{r}
# CREATE THE DATAFRAME
data <- read_csv('Covid_Age.csv')
data <- data_frame(data)
head(data)
```

## Check for Null Values

```{r}
#CHECK FOR NULL VALUES IN THE DF
is.null(data) 
```

```{r}
#Number of Cases each week
fig <- plot_ly(data, x = ~Week, y = ~Cases, type = 'scatter', mode='lines+markers')
fig
```

```{r}
#Age v/s Number of cases
fig_1 <- plot_ly(data, x = ~Age, y = ~Cases, type = 'bar')
fig_1
```

## Conclusion
- There was a peek in the number of cases by the mid of May 2021
- People with age more than 75 were more affected than other age groups.
